      "summary": "This is my first position, related to Java Enterprise. I was impressed by the size and complexity of the system, which I had the opportunity to maintain and develop. Accepting the challenge, I plunged into work. For a short period I have learnt and then worked with the Java world technologies such as Spring Framework and Spring MVC web framework. In the process of implementation of the new features, I had to face with the system's front-end. It was implemented using JQuery library and some other components, which had been written before me. Architectural system was a classic three-galleries monolith. So of course I had to study the database. The project used the Oracle 11 DBMS. Quite often, I had to write queries to the database even though the fact, that the project was used Hibernate JPA provider. Also, data source selection has been designed quite unusual, but about it - on an interview ;-) (Note: All the above does not violate the NDA.) I was interested in this position, not only from a technological point of view. Workflow required from me some communication skills, also the first time in my career, such as a multi-pronged communication (written communication, for example, in Jira, verbal at the weekly Skype meetings) in non-native English language for me.",
